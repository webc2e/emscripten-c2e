launchurl
---------


Launchurl attempts to determine the users 'preferred' web browser and to
launch a url with it. It checks for KDE and Gnome, both of which have ways
to launch a browser. If neither of those is installed, it tries for the
BROWSER environment variable, and failing that it tries a hardcoded list
of browsers which might be installed.

usage:
launchurl [-d|-debug] [-v|-version] url

eg:
./launchurl http://www.google.com



Please it out on your computer and maybe have a quick look at the source.

The Makefile is very basic, but should work ok. Just type 'make'.
I've also included the binary
I compiled on my system (i386 Debian).


Bug reports, patches, suggestions and other feedback would be most welcome!
