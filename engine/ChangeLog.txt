Changes since 2-286:

Francis: Added EAME engine_decouple_mouse, which lets you detach
the physical mouse from the agent mouse PNTR.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 2-285:



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 2-283:



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 2-282:

Francis: Screensaver mode now quits game if you move the
mouse during startup/loading (no keyboard detection yet).

Francis: Other screensaver mode tweaks, to make it 
possible to use it with Docking Station as well.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 2-281:



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 2-280:



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 2-279:



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 2-278:



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 2-276:

Francis: Fixed bug in JECT, so it now works if there is no output
stream.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 2-275:

Francis: Added JECT command, to inject files from Bootstrap.

Francis: Fixed minimum volume for MUTE, so ds bug #709 fixed

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 2-274:

Francis: Fixed up body part algorithm to be more compatible with Wafuru's
sprites, and our incomplete sets of attachment points.  It now prefers 
files of opposite sex to ones of different breed.

Francis: Made PRAY REFR quicker.  It doesn't rescan if the directories
haven't changed, which is the case most of the time.  A consequence of
this is that it won't notice if the contents of a file change.  That isn't a
problem though, I hope - you can always use PRAY KILL to delete a file
before making the new one, and this will force a refresh.

Gavin:  New commands:

SOUL <facultyId>
	Returns whether the creature faculty of the type specified
	is being processed or not.

SOUL <facultyId> <on=1 or 0>
	Enable (1) or disable (0) the update on the creature's faculty
	as given by type id is follows: Sensory Faculty (0), Brain (1),
	Motor Faculty (2), Linguistic Faculty (3), Biochemistry (4),
	Reproductive Faculty (5), Expressive Faculty (6), 
	Music Faculty (7), Life Faculty (8)

STEP <facultyId>
Does one update of the specified faculty (for faculty id see SOUL).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 2-273:

Francis: Disabled frame pointer optimisation, as it could crash the stack
back tracing.  That was invaluable error reporting, and the speed improvement
is only maybe 3%.  Could be turned on if we had fewer bugs, but then you should
turn off stack back tracing in CStyleException, just trace the top level item.

Hopefully the new checking hasn't slowed it down at all noticeably.  I avoided
putting in really thorough checking; I suspect what we have is good enough.
More can be added, but there is more risk of slowing things down.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 2-272:

Francis: Improved loading progress bar so it is smooth (it is now based on 
number of bytes loaded, rather than agents being serialised in).  This
is particularly noticeable if you have lots of creatures in your world.

Francis: Added creature location validation, so if one does get in an 
invalid location it is beamed to safety.  A message is written to the
log file saying where it happened.

"Emergency escape for creature from down foot 2817.000000, 879.515381.
The map is too tight for the skeletal creatures to properly fit in."

This is necessarily the fault of the map, as to be honest we've never
managed to make maps that satisfy the requirements of the physics 
system.  However, the message is written to the log file so that we are
encouraged to at least try and do so.  A bad map where a Norn constantly
has to be beamed to safety would slow the game down a lot.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 2-271:

Francis: Considerable speedup to body part finding algorithm, rewriting 
completely the existing brute force code.  Importing is now a lot quicker,
but still not quick enough, I suspect. Growl.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 2-270:

Francis: PRAY IMPO could cause an unhandled exception in the case where
the file was removed from under its feet.  Fixed to it correctly returns an error.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 2-269:

Francis: Startup logging for debugging startup crashes.  You can't specify
this in the config file, as it hasn't been read when the logging starts.  To set
it, make a file called "logtastic" in the same directory as the engine.  The
log is written to creatures_engine_logfile.txt.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 2-268:

Francis: Filename safety checker improved to strip initial and trailing dots and
initial spaces.

Francis: Build number added to title bar

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 2-267:

Francis: NEWC now works.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 2-266:

Francis: Security fixes courtesy of Theo.  PRAY MAKE was like a sieve.  You could
read and write arbtiary files from CAOS.  Now fixed.  This may have broken some
pray stuff - you have to PRAY MAKE entirely in the current directory, you can't
refer to other files.  Also, you can't inject files in the MAIN directory any 
more.

Francis: WEBB now works with spaces in URLs (converts to %20 for you and possible
security reasons)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 2-265:

Francis: Now just deletes pray files in PRAY KILL (previously they were porched,
which was hopeless).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 2-264:

Francis: Speed up compressed bitmap loading by sizing vector in advance.

Francis: EAME and GAME variables now throw an error for ones named "" (empty
string).  This was causing trouble with enumerations over GAME variables
in the DS contact book.

Francis: Cache for body part finding code.  Norn importing, creating, warping,
loading worlds and ageing should all now be quicker.  The first Norn made or
loaded may still make a slight pause, but ones after that should be quicker.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 2-262:

Francis: Hopefully fixed alpha sprites in 555 mode when clipped.

Francis: Spaces at end of world names removed.

Francis: Turned a compiler optimisation back on, might be slightly
quicker (less good stack traces on CStyleException though - we haven't
had many of those recently, the class A bugs are straight lockups).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 2-261:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 2-260:

Francis: Maximize now works (this being missing has been 
annoying me for a while!)

Francis: Fixed photo deleting problems with history reconciliation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 2-259:

Gavin: Added commands as follows:

MOTR (state):
Enable (1) or disable (0) the creature TARG's motor faculty.
(Also an R-Value)

DCOR (state):
Enable (1) or disable (0) the creature TARG's core being shown graphically.

(returns 1 or 0) TCOR (topY bottomY leftX rightX):
Tests whether it's safe to change the bounding box of the physical core
of the object TARG (a kind of test CORE command).

DSEE (state):
Enable (1) or disable (0) agents being highlighted when they can be seen
by any creature.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 2-257:


Gavin: Added commands as follows:

MIND (state):
Enable (1) or disable (0) the creature's brain (unlike @#ZOMB#@ in that the brain 
actually stops processing and it's output is frozen onto the one noun and verb).
(Also an R-Value)

CORE (topY bottomY leftX rightX):
Sets the bounding box of the physical core of the object TARG.  May be set to 
smaller (or larger) than the sprite's rectangle.

SEEN (category):
Returns the agent which the creature TARG has currently in mind for the category specified.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 2-255:



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 2-254:

Francis: Last page scroll option added to FRMT.  This is useful for chat 
windows and other scrolling windows (the CAOS command line could have done
with it rather than the hack it uses!)

Francis: You can now move around text entry fields with the cursor keys,
insert text, and delete it with Backspace or Delete.

Francis: Specify multiple colours within text parts with <tint> tags.
See the help on PTXT for more information.

Francis: Primitive Copy and Paste with Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V.  Paste pastes
into the active text entry part, copy copies either from that part, or
from the text part that the mouse is over. The text part is search for
as with HOTP.

Francis: Fixed PRAY INJT so it returns error codes and messages better

Francis: You can now set message_id -1 for text entry parts, and then you
can insert carriage returns in them.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 2-253:


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 2-252:



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 2-251:



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 2-250:



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 2-249:

Francis: Fixed problem with importing breed A/B/C creatures into a game
with only breed D sprites available.  This was a general problem - it assumed
breed A was always installed as a fallback.

Francis: Customise which .mng file is precached.

Francis: Added NET: ERRA and NET: RAWE for login connection failure error
reporting.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 2-248:

Francis: Added LIMB command (which calculates a creature body part filename
from creature attributes), and made FACE work over serialisation with
files missing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 2-247:

Francis: Moved password saving variable to be GAME rather than EAME,
as that is more logical!  Made it so password is actively deleted
if the "keep password" variable isn't set.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 2-246:



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 2-243:

Francis: Fixed image conversion code, so 555 mode will work now.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 2-241:

Francis: Changed VOLM command and added a VOLM rvalue.  You can now set the volume
for effects, MIDI and ambient music independently.

Francis: Added HOTP which returns the compound part under the pointer. (It
might not do this exactly as you expect - see the documentation).  Useful for
tooltips and the like.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 2-237:



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 2-235:

Francis: Fixed bug in catalogue error messages (when over 512 bytes).

Francis: Tidied up camera panning code, making it reset properly when a new
pan is resumed, and making it default to overshooting (cut off) rather
than undershooting and moving slowly.

Francis: Apostrophe fixed in pray messaging

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 2-234:

Francis: No, really, PRAY MAKE and NET: MAKE will work again now!

Francis: Swear word filtering.  Applies to anything displayed using PTXT, which
means everything displayed as text by games.  If someone wants
to write a violent swearing motherfucker game with c2e, they'll have to add
some kind of EAME variable to allow you to turn the filter off...

Francis: Simplify the way the auxiliary bootstrap specifying game variables
work - they are saved in each world's directory, so only apply when LOADing
a brand new shiny world.

Francis: Added facility to load/save to the Journal folder of _other_ worlds.
See FILE IOPE, FILE OOPE help for more info.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 2-233:

Francis: PRAY MAKE and NET: EXPO should work again (relative directories problem).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 2-231:

Francis: More support for user directories.

Francis: EAME "engine_clone_upon_import" will make all Norns clone upon import.

Francis: You can add custom meta-data from CAOS to creature export files, including
warp files.  This is done by setting NAME variables on the creature before export -
for example 
	TARG NORN
	SETV NAME "Pray Extra Rebound" 1

Francis: Default metaroom now 800 by 600 rather than 8000 by 8000 (avoids confusion and
makes GMAP work better!)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 2-230:



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 2-229:



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 2-225:

Francis: Added PRAY FORE and PRAY BACK.  They're like PRAY PREV and PRAY NEXT
except they don't loop at the end, instead returning empty string.

Gavin:  Fixed a problem with CALL where it would accidentally execute some
of the caller script even when in the middle of the callee script.  Also,
caller or callee scripts are free to set their own INSTness independently
and CALL will never change your INSTness.

Francis:  Fixed some issues with the auxiliary directory migration - Worlds
were getting mixed up.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 2-222:

Francis: PAT: MOVE to move compound parts.

Francis: WEBB command to launch a URL in the user's browser.  It's very slow 
on my machine, but that might be because it is in the debugger and because
my machine doesn't work very well, so let me know if you have any problems!

Francis: EAME variables which are similar to GAME variables.  They
aren't saved with the world, but they do persist between different worlds
within one session.

Francis: EAME variables to choose which auxiliary bootstrap directories are
actually loaded in when you next LOAD a world.  engine_no_auxiliary_bootstrap_nnn. 
This can be used to choose whether to have a docked or non-docked world
in Docking Station, but no doubt other things.

Francis: New catalogue identifier "OVERRIDE" can go after either ARRAY
or TAG.  This says that that catalogue entry can replace an existing
one.  The catalogues are read in alphabetical order, and the override must
come after the actual one.  Catalogues between auxiliary directories can
also override each other.

Gavin:  Fixed ZOMB command so that it doesn't stop the current script if you're
calling it from the creature's VM.

Francis: Alpha channels (in old display engine) now work for nom-compressed
sprites and hence text and hopefully all cloned galleries (e.g. camera views).

Francis: CATO overrides the category of a particular agent.  Normally category
is specified entirely by classifier (based on the catalogue entry
"Agent Classifiers").  CATA returns the category of a particular agent, using
either its override value if it has one, or else based on its classifier.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 2-221:

Alima: Made ALPH work for docking station.

Alima: Added BOOT command to enable mini games to load specified bootstrap folders.
These bootstrap folders are outside of the regular game system.

Francis: You can now do FLTO/MVTO/MVBY on the mouse.

Francis: TINT rvalue to return the current genetically specified pigmentation of a
Skeletal Creature.

Francis: Fixed debug meta room change keys when the meta rooms don't have
contiguous IDs.

Francis: Guttering when metaroom smaller than display should work now.  Sends
a resize event as well so the floating UI controls move correctly.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 2-220:

Francis: Added ABBA which returns the absolute base.  This is the number passed into
the NEW: SIMP comand etc., different from BASE

Francis: Added PNXT to enumerate through the compound parts of an agent.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 2-212:

Francis: Added MODU to tell you which display engine you're using and which
modules are loaded.  Added extra lines to error dialog to say the exact 
version of the operating system you're using, and the display engine / modules.

Alima: Remote cameras and line command now work fully.

Francis: New configuration keys in machine.cfg.  ""Win32 Auxiliary Game Name 1" "Creatures 3"
specifies a game name whose directories are used as "auxiliary directories".  This means
that images, sounds and so on are read from those directories if they can't be found in 
the main directory.  You can also individually specify auxiliary directories with 
"Auxiliary 1 Body Data Directory" and so on.  The Bootstrap directories are also
shared.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 2-208:

Gavin:  Debug builds now look for "engineDebug-*.dll"
		Anything else looks for "engine-*.dll" as before.

Francis: HIST WVET - is/was that Norn a warp hole veteran.

Francis: Various bug fixes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 2-207:

Gavin:  There is now an ATTRibute (1024) for agents which specifies whether
they use the new rotation stuff or not.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 2-206:

Gavin:  Support for auto-rotating agents (with sprites) as follows

Added SPIN, AVEL, FVEL, SVEL, ADMP, AFMP, SDMP (all r-values to read and commands
to set) which are:

SPIN:  Your current angle specified as a float from 0.0 to 1.0 (where 0.0 means 
North, 0.25 East, 0.5 South and 0.75 West).
AVEL:  Your current angular velocity (0.0 as 1.0 as above) which adjusts the SPIN
of the agent each tick.
FVEL, SVEL:  Your current forwards/sideways velocities, i.e. velocity in the direction
of your facing (SPIN) and perpendicular to your facing (SPIN+0.25).  Note that setting
these values will result in VELX and VELY changing appropriately and vice versa.

ADMP:  Your angular damping (0.0 to 1.0) which says how quickly you stop spinning.
FDMP, SDMP:  Your forwards and sideways damping (0.0 to 1.0) which dictate how
quickly you stop travelling in those directions.

ANGL:  Returns the angle (0.0 to 1.0 as above) from TARG to the map coordinate given.
VECX, VECY:  Returns the X and Y coordinates of the unit vector in the direction of
the angle given.

ROTN:  This is the command that sets up how the engine automatically chooses the right
base image for the sea monkey based on what rotation it is.  There are two arguments:
"no_of_sprites_for_each_rotation" and "no_of_rotations".  The engine assumes that the
sprite file is stored with all the sprites for one rotation together starting with 
pointing north.  By default these values are 8 and 12 respectively which are correct
for the seam-cartoon sprites I have anyway.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 2-204:

Francis: Added NAME and MAME.  These are named variables local to a specific
agent.  They are a kind of cross between GAME and MVxx/OVxx.

Francis: Added DELN and NAMN to delete and enumerate name variables.

Gavin:  Fixed a couple of problems with the 2D CAs:  some rooms were getting 
diffused into twice by mistake, also the code failed to send out the right script
for links versus neighbours.

Daniel: Added UFOs (Uname For Operating System) - basically tells you what OS
you are running on at the moment

Daniel: Adapted NAME, MAME, DELN and NAMN to work with any index type (m)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 2-203:

Gavin:  Fixed up category selection so that it works in XY, not just the X direction.

Gavin:  CALG now sets/reads the category representative algorithm for creatures.
This allows you to say whether it always chooses the closest bit of (say) food,
or a random on screen, etc.

Francis: FROM is now a variable, rather than an agent rvalue.  This is so messages
sent over the network can have FROM set to the user, a string.  Hopefully it 
hasn't broken anything :-)  As an extra side effect you can now change FROM, although
I'm not sure why you'd want to.

Francis: BUZZ lets you change the interval between ticks.  This is by default
50 milliseconds (20 frames per second).  There might be some parts of the 
game that don't respect this properly, or calculate things from it properly, so
watch out!

Daniel: Ported FastFloatToInt to gcc for Intel platforms on Linux. Also, Fixed FILE_GLOB
for non WIN32 platform

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 2-202:

Francis: Added NOTV (amazed it wasn't there already, only NEGV!) which does
bitwise nots.  You can use this to turn off an attribute in a more forwards
compatible way than we did in C3:
	setv va10 attr
	setv va11 64
	notv va11
	andv va10 va11 

Alima + Francis: Bug fixes for map drawing, lines and the window being
the right size.

Gavin:  Added some more callback navigation scripts for Creature Agents so that
they now know when they're going towards a LINK or a regular neighbouring room,
etc.  Also, the ageing callback has changed script number.

Gavin:  Navigational CAs can now be made to diffuse properly in 2 dimensions by
flagging them as Super-Navigable in the "Creatures 3" catalogue file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 2-200:


Gavin:  Agents can now have more than one virtual machine.  The "CALL" command
pushes the current VM on the stack, runs a script on a new one, then returns to
the old VM to finish off processing.  No variables are shared between the two
scripts (except OVs through OWNR of course) except that arguments can be passed
to the 'subroutine' through _P1_ and _P2_.

Gavin:  The "NEW: CRAG" now creates a CReature AGent, which is basically a
regular creature minus skeletal graphics but plus compound agent functionality.

Creature Agents currently callback two scripts, 150 and 151.  150 is for navigation,
151 is called just before ageing.  Check the CAOS help on script numbers for
details.


Francis: Can now have modular extensions, which are DLLs that if present
add CAOS commands to the engine.  These DLLs will all have names of the
form engine-*.dll.  They are searched for in the current directory when
the game is launched.  The NET: Babel commands are in such a separate
DLL.

Francis: Various bug fixes - in particular, importing a creature into a
world where the map position it comes in at is invalid.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes since unification:

Welcome to the new unified Creatures 2D Engine!

This engine contains the changes to the Creatures 3 engine made
for the patches, the additions for Docking Station, and the more
portable code base that Ben has been working on.

Hopefully everything still works, but there is bound to be something
that we've broken!  So please watch out...

Francis: UPPA and LOWA now work with accented characters, as appropriate
to the locale set in the registry.  Other locale settings are now more
general - so you can have explicit accented characters in strings from CAOS, 
for example.

Francis: C-style exceptions give better error reporting (still not
great in release mode, as Frame-Pointer Omission optimisation reduces
its usefulness).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
